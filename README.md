# MTA LIVE

## About
The purpose of this project is to create a live MTA bus tracking app that will give you the time a bus will arrive. The cool thing is that I plan to integrate live traffic data to be able to better predict what time the bus will come with minimal variance. The goal is that it arrives in a +/- 30 sec of when the app says it will come.
